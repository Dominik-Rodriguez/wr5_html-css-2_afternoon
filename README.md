## HTML/CSS 2 Afternoon

Instructions

1) Fork this repo
2) Clone your forked version
3) Create the index.html, index.css files to get a site looking as closely as possible to https://devmountain.com/
4) Don't worry about functionality, only looks (you should use your own image for the background)
5) After dismissing the 'Events banner' message at the top, you will only need to worry about the parts down to, but not including, the message "Due to COVID-19, Devmountain..."
6) When done, push up your code
7) Submit your repo link on canvas like previous afternoon projects
8) If you have extra time, feel free to clone the rest of the site for practice, but you do not need to submit this.
